Twitter Bot (Inactive)
This was an attempt to create a Python bot using BeautifulSoup, Tkinter, and sqlite3, aimed at automating bulk Twitter account creation. The bot could generate bulk accounts, tweet predefined content, and interact with users following a specific agenda (via replies, messages or other stuff).

Note: All visible API keys in this repository belong to deleted accounts.
